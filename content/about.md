# Why are we here?
Truonix is a new venture that will focus on bringing meaningful solutions and real partnerships in the field of Information and Application Security.  Over several years the information security industry has evolved past the typical "silver-biullet" solutions and is ready for an approach that's uniquely different and re-establishes what it is to form a meaningful and productive partnership.

# Who are we not?
The industry is saturated with security companies, and it may be a good idea to explain who we are NOT:
* We are not resellers of security products and don't have a magic solution to everyone's security challenges.  
* We don't have all the answers, and we know that you probably don't know either... which menas we must work together
* We will not borrow your watch to tell you what time it is

# Why is the website so cryptic and does not have more information?

We are currently in the process of engaging with a few select organizations as Beta clients.  In the beginning, we would like to focus on organizations that manage 100+ custom application deployments.  Over the next year we will build our solutions and services to a point when we will actively solicit new business.  For now, we have to be selective.  Having said that, if you are interested in being one of our first clients, please email [Us](mailto:info@truonix.com)
